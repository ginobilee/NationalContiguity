# NationalContiguity

This is a Free Code Camp challenge.  Use d3.js' Force Directed Graph to fullfill a National Contiguity.

Use canvas to draw the chart.So I used mousemove+simulation.find+div to implement country name showing.

In d3.v4, force.size if no longer supported. So I implemented boundary check in 'tick' handler to ensure nodes in the chart.
